A pantograph gauntlet is driven by your own motion and mirrors your arm's movements—a punch thrown with your fist moves the pantograph, extending the weight out at a rapid speed to land blows up to 10 feet away. In some regions, such as Alkenstar and Ustalav, pantograph gauntlets are occasionally constructed entirely of metal and fashioned in the likeness of oversized arms, incorporating a complex system of gears or a miniature steam engine in place of the simpler pantograph mechanism.

Reload 1 Type Ranged Category Martial Group Firearm --- No one's entirely certain who developed the spoon gun, but all authorities agree that it was probably a goblin. Essentially a terrible idea in firearm form, the spoon gun is a spring-powered hand cannon with a modified grip that uses miscellaneous knives, forks, chopsticks, and spoons as ammunition. Users typically upend the entire contents of their cutlery drawer into the gun, aim it in the general direction of the foe, and hope it hits something. This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the scatter (5 feet) trait and uses cutlery or similar-sized objects as ammunition instead of bullets (enough cheap cutlery to fire ten shots costs 1 sp). Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand cannons apply to both weapons.

Reload 1 Type Ranged Category Martial Group Firearm Ammunition Firearm Ammunition (10 rounds) --- Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the ‘hand' part of ‘hand cannon', this comically-oversized gun has a heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome quantity of gunpowder. This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the fatal d12 trait and a range of 20 feet. It also has the following modified critical failure condition: Critical Failure The attack misses, the weapon misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it explodes in your face. Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand cannons apply to both weapons.
