If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn't use Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire. To learn the spell, you must do the following: Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession. Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4–3. Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on Table 4–3). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs.

Success You recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful clue about your current situation. Critical Failure You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue. The following skills can be used to Recall Knowledge, getting information about the listed topics. In some cases, you can get the GM's permission to use a different but related skill, usually against a higher DC than normal. Some topics might appear on multiple lists, but the skills could give different information. For example, Arcana might tell you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas Crafting could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks. Arcana : Arcane theories, magical traditions, creatures of arcane significance, and arcane planes. Crafting : Alchemical reactions and creatures, item value, engineering, unusual materials, and constructs. Lore : The subject of the Lore skill's subcategory. Medicine : Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics. Nature : The environment, flora, geography, weather, creatures of natural origin, and natural planes. Occultism : Ancient mysteries, obscure philosophy, creatures of occult significance, and esoteric planes. Religion : Divine agents, divine planes, theology, obscure myths, and creatures of religious significance. Society : Local history, key personalities, legal institutions, societal structure, and humanoid culture. The GM might allow checks to Recall Knowledge using other skills. For example, you might assess the skill of an acrobat using Acrobatics. If you're using a physical skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely have you use a mental ability score—typically Intelligence—instead of the skill's normal physical ability score.

You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items, the Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items, and the Snare Crafting feat to create snares. To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements: The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary. You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas for more information. You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield, or an alchemist's lab to produce alchemical items. You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in materials to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item. This amount is determined using Table 4–2: Income Earned, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of Crafting appears in the sidebar. Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting. Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank. Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over. Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the rest.

Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block—for example, “Reaction verbal.” Long Casting Times Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted (see Disrupted and Lost Spells below). Spell Components Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as “Three Actions material, somatic, verbal.\" The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell. Material (manipulate) Somatic (manipulate) Verbal (concentrate) Focus (manipulate) Disrupted and Lost Spells Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot, spent the spell's costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain a Spell action, the spell immediately ends. The full rules for disrupting actions appear here.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-73","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect.

This is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions, as listed in the item's stat block. Some items can be activated as a reaction or free action. In this case, you Activate the Item as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases are noted in the item's Activate entry in its stat block—for example, “Activate Reaction command.” Long Activation Times Some items take minutes or hours to activate. The Activate an Item activity for these items includes a mix of the listed activation components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while activating such an item, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and you can't activate them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're activating one, your activation is disrupted (see the Disrupting Activations sidebar). Activation Components Each activation entry lists any components involved in the activation after the action icons or text, such as “Single Action command.” The activation components, described below, add traits (listed in parentheses) and requirements to the activation. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Activate the Item. Command (auditory, concentrate) Envision (concentrate) Interact (manipulate) Cast a Spell Activation Components An item's activate entry lists the components required to activate its abilities. Each component adds certain traits to the Activate an Item activity, and some components have special requirements. The components that appear in this book are listed below. ### Command This component is a specific utterance you must make in a loud and strong voice. Activate an Item gains the auditory and concentrate traits. You must be able to speak to provide this component. ### Envision This component is a specific image or phenomenon you need to imagine. Activate an Item gains the concentrate trait. ### Interact This component works like the Interact basic action. Activate an Item gains the manipulate trait and requires you to use your hands, just like with any Interact action. ### Cast a Spell If an item lists “Cast a Spell” after “Activate,” the activation requires you to use the Cast a Spell activity to Activate the Item. This happens when the item replicates a spell. You must have a spellcasting class feature to Activate an Item with this activation component. If the item can be used for a specific spell, the action icon for that spell is provided. If it's an item like a staff, which can be used for many spells, the icon is omitted, and you must refer to each spell to determine which actions you must spend to Activate the Item to cast it. In this case, Activate an Item gains all the traits from the relevant components of the Cast a Spell activity.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-101","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 532"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=101","weakness":{},"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Strike","actions_number":2,"id":"action-101","text":" Activate Single Action Strike; ","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-102","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 532"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=102","weakness":{},"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Interact","actions_number":2,"id":"action-102","text":" Activate Single Action Interact; ","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-103","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 532"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=103","weakness":{},"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Interact or 1 or more days; see below","actions_number":2,"id":"action-103","text":" Activate Single Action Interact or 1 or more days; see below; ","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-104","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You grant allies within 100 feet a +2 status bonus to saves against  fear  effects for 1 minute.

After the end of the process, the philosopher’s extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature’s unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature’s DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature’s physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants. Unlike normal for mutagens and effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls, you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional concoction you drink. However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you’ve consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation may leave some amount of your personality and memories intact, at the GM’s discretion.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-405","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":" Serithtial  spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th level   heal   or   zone of truth   spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).","source_raw":["Gamemastery Guide pg. 112"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Gamemastery Guide"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=405","frequency":"once per hour","weakness":{},"release_date":"2020-02-26","rarity_id":1,"name":"envision","id":"action-405","text":" Activate envision; Frequency once per hour; Effect Serithtial spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th level heal or zone of truth spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).","category":"action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-406","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You recall the  shot of the First Vault , which automatically reloads itself into your weapon.

You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining. Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor. Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances). When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want. Feats You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat. Skills You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites. You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation. Class Features You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard school—always at least a month.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-523","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"source_raw":["Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet pg. 74"],"source_category":"Adventure Paths","source":["Pathfinder #156: The Apocalypse Prophet"],"trigger":"You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack.","type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=523","weakness":{},"source_group":"Extinction Curse","release_date":"2020-06-24","rarity_id":1,"name":"Interact","actions_number":0,"id":"action-523","text":" Activate Free Action Interact; Trigger You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack.; ","category":"action","actions":"Free Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-524","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You open the locket to unleash the dreams it has kept at bay.

Critical Success The user's body, mind, and soul are infused with alien energies drawn from the Dark Tapestry, which transforms the user into an aberration of a level no higher than their current level +4. This new form could be an existing aberration or a unique one of the GM's creation. The user retains their memories and spellcasting ability (including any rituals they know) but becomes chaotic evil and loses all other abilities they possessed in their previous form. Success As critical success, but the aberration the user transforms into can be of a level no higher than half the user's current level. Failure The user's attempt to change is a painful mistake that deals 10d6+40 bludgeoning damage as their body twists, bends and breaks. Ultimately, they are not transformed. Critical Failure The user is slain, but their body shifts and transforms into a brand new creature as the bodiless alien intelligence Tchekuth incubates within the user's flesh, mind and soul. This transformation takes another 7 days to complete but can be halted indefinitely if the Void Mirror is placed in a specially constructed frame aimed at the body's location (regardless of any solid object between the mirror and the body).

You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical. After you use Spellstrike, you can't do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn't recharge your Spellstrike. Spellstrike Specifics Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack. One Target : The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures. Reach : The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer. Ancillary Effects : Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot 's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell. Multiple Defenses : Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target : If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell. Variable Actions : Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions. Metamagic : You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.","category":"action","actions":"Two Actions","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-756","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You divert a portion of the spell's magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork. …","source_raw":["Secrets of Magic pg. 38"],"trait_group":["Class","Class-Specific"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","requirement":"You used your most recent action this turn to Cast a Spell or make a  Spellstrike .You need to meet this requirement only to enter the stance, not to remain in it.","source":["Secrets of Magic"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=756","weakness":{},"release_date":"2021-09-01","rarity_id":1,"trait_raw":["Concentrate","Magus","Stance"],"name":"Arcane Cascade","trait":["Concentrate","Magus","Stance"],"actions_number":2,"id":"action-756","text":" Arcane Cascade Single Action Source Secrets of Magic pg. 38 1.1 Requirements You used your most recent action this turn to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike.You need to meet this requirement only to enter the stance, not to remain in it. --- You divert a portion of the spell's magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork.

The exact form of your effort varies depending on the skill you use, the resources you have available, and other circumstances. Decide if you are searching for the name of a specific individual or for names in general. If you're looking for the name of an individual, you must be able to clearly identify that individual; for example, “the general leading the invasion” is enough, but “the person who killed the duchess” isn't, if you don't know who killed the duchess. If you're searching for names more generally, name one creature type. The GM chooses a DC, typically based on the level of the creature in question. If you're seeking names more generally, the DC is typically based on the level of the creature whose name the GM decides to provide, usually a creature from the chosen type of your level or lower. The GM might modify the DC of the task based on the resources you have available, or on using an unusually appropriate or inappropriate skill, or on other circumstances. Attempt a check with a skill that could be used to Recall Knowledge about the creature's type.

Once activated, the pistol can't be activated again for 1d4 hours. ## Pistol of Wonder d% Wondrous Effect 1–2 The pistol casts phantom steed (4th level) to produce a pale horse adjacent to you; only you can ride it. 3 The target becomes a shiny metal color (bronze, copper, or iron) and any sound or speech becomes tinny and robotic in nature; this effect lasts 1 month. 4–5 The pistol casts dimensional anchor . 6 Modify memory (6th level) causes the target to forget you ever existed; you can't Sustain the Spell. 7–13 A short rod protrudes from the pistol and unfurls a small flag that reads “Bang!”. The pistol can't be fired until the flag is removed, which requires a single Interact action. 14–16 You are pushed 30 feet directly away from the target; if you hit an object or creature, you stop, but take falling damage equal to the distance you moved (if you hit a creature, it takes the same amount of falling damage). 17–19 The target is pushed 30 feet directly away from you; if it hits an object or creature, it stops, but takes falling damage equal to the distance it moved (if it hits another creature, the other creature takes the same amount of falling damage). 20 You don't need to eat or drink for 1 week. 21–25 The pistol casts cloudkill . 26–30 The pistol casts heroism on you. 31 The pistol casts tree shape on you, except you appear as a Medium wooden grave marker bearing your name and the current date; you can't Dismiss the spell for 1 round. 32 The pistol casts mask of terror , except the target appears as a more fearsome and violent version of itself to all observers. 33–35 The target knows you have a bullet with its name on it; the first time you Strike the target with the pistol before the end of your next turn, roll the attack roll twice and take the highest result (this is a fortune effect). 36–37 The pistol casts cloak of colors on you with a duration of 1d10 rounds. 38–47 The pistol casts hydraulic push (4th level) as water streams from the pistol. 48–50 The pistol casts dimension door on you, teleporting you to the space adjacent to the target opposite your current position; if that space isn't clear, you instead teleport to the nearest open space. 51 The pistol casts disintegrate . 52 Dozens of tattered, nonmagical playing cards burst from the pistol's barrel. 53–54 Shadows crowd around the target, making all creatures concealed to the target while not in bright light; this effect lasts for 1 hour. 55–57 Normal vegetation within 30 feet of the target immediately dies and turns to ash. 58 The pistol casts dinosaur form on you to transform you into a triceratops; the pistol protrudes from the base of your front horn, and you can fire (but not reload) the pistol while in this form. 59 All non-artifact ammunition in your possession crumbles to dust. 60–69 You are quickened for 1 minute. You can use the extra action only to reload or fire the pistol. 70–71 The target is quickened for 1 minute. It can use the extra action only to Step or Stride. 72-79 The pistol casts phantasmal killer . 80–81 Dozens of bullet holes appear in the target's nonmagical clothing. The effect is purely cosmetic. 82–85 The pistol casts outcast's curse . 86 The pistol vanishes, reappearing among your possessions once it can be activated again. 87–91 The pistol casts solid fog , but with swirling dust and sand instead of fog. 92–96 The pistol casts stoneskin on you, making your skin rough and leathery; the target ignores the resistance you gain from this spell, and the target's attacks don't reduce the spell's duration. 97–99 The pistol casts uncontrollable dance with a duration of 3 rounds, even on a failure or critical failure. 100 Reroll two results and apply both in the order rolled; further results of 100 on these rerolls have no effect.

Magical ammunition created this way lasts 10 minutes or until you fire it, whichever comes first. ## Lucky Draw Bandolier d6 Ability (Suit) Ammunition 1 Strength (Hammer) Meteor shot 2 Dexterity (Key) Storm arrow 3 Constitution (Shield) Corrosive ammunition 4 Intelligence (Book) Explosive ammunition 5 Wisdom (Star) Terrifying ammunition 6 Charisma (Crown) Fairy bullet ","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-992","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You gain  darkvision  until the beginning of your next turn, as long as you continue to look through the scope.","source_raw":["Guns & Gears pg. 180"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Guns & Gears"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=992","weakness":{},"release_date":"2021-10-13","rarity_id":1,"name":"Interact","actions_number":2,"id":"action-992","text":" Activate Single Action Interact; Effect You gain darkvision until the beginning of your next turn, as long as you continue to look through the scope.","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-993","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"The next Strike you make this round with the gun to which the scope is attached has its scatter radius increased by 5 feet.","source_raw":["Guns & Gears pg. 181"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Guns & Gears"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=993","weakness":{},"release_date":"2021-10-13","rarity_id":1,"name":"Interact","actions_number":2,"id":"action-993","text":" Activate Single Action Interact; Effect The next Strike you make this round with the gun to which the scope is attached has its scatter radius increased by 5 feet.","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-994","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"While gazing through the scope, you zoom in on your targets to make it easier to hit them at a distance.

The memory palace has a 30-foot-square central courtyard surrounded by 12 10-foot-square chambers. Arranged within these chambers are various items referred to as the palace's nodes—statues, tapestries, fountains, and other works of art are common, but a node can take other forms at the GM's discretion. As a 10-minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure. When you do, the node changes its shape and appearance to visually represent the memory you have imprinted onto it. If the node was already imprinted with a memory, the old one can be overwritten to repurpose the node. Memories you have imprinted on a node can be mentally accessed at any time by a creature holding the memory palace in its miniature form, regardless of who imprinted them. This grants a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM's discretion, but a node shouldn't grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with Recall Knowledge checks for such trees, but it wouldn't grant the benefits for all Nature checks to Recall Knowledge. A memory palace node can also store the text from a spellbook or magical tome, but these memories aren't a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can't prepare spells from a memory palace, though they could use it as source material to try to Learn a Spell. However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the memory palace , few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren't real, and thus don't cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger. Many memory palaces have leftover memories from previous users—now long dead—imprinted on their various nodes.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-1063","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You cast   faerie fire  .

Spectral bearers have the statistics of an unseen servant, except they're strong enough to carry the palanquin and its occupants. They move generally along a basic set of directions you indicate upon activation, which can include turns onto various streets, but they don't take other creatures' feelings into account and can be inconsiderate to passersby in an inhabited area as they relentlessly move you forward. The bearers move slowly but steadily along their simple directions. While the palanquin is perfectly suitable for overland travel, the bearers' imprecise movements and the requirement to reactivate the palanquin to change destinations make it unsuited for a combat encounter or other situation where seconds and precise movements count. The palanquin's interior ceiling is painted with the same night sky pattern as the cloth, and dark curtains hang over the windows. The palanquin protects its occupants from sunlight and severe heat and cold (though not extreme or incredible heat or cold) as well as blocks most non-damaging forms of weather. The palanquin is only as sturdy as a standard wooden carriage—if it would be destroyed, it instantly reverts to a square of fabric and can't be Activated again for 1 month.

You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to deconstruct alchemical items and the Magical Crafting skill feat to deconstruct magic items. To Deconstruct an item, you must meet the following requirements. The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary. The item isn't a cursed item, artifact, or other item that is similarly hard to destroy. The item isn't a consumable item. The item has a listed Price. You must have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to deconstruct a metal shield or an alchemist's lab to de-concoct alchemical items. At the start of this process, you must decide if you're using the deconstructed item to build a new, similar item, of if you are simply breaking it down for raw ingredients that can be used at a later date for any item. In either case, this activity takes 1 day to perform, but if you're using the item to create a new, similar item, that day can be counted as one of the crafting days for the new item. At the end of the activity, you must attempt a Crafting check. The GM sets the DC of this check based on the level of the item you are attempting to deconstruct, its rarity, and other circumstances. Critical Success If you are deconstructing the item to make a new, similar item, you can apply 80% of the cost of the deconstructed item to the new item. If you are deconstructing the item for raw materials alone, you can apply 55% of the cost of the deconstructed item to a single new item. In either case, if this is in excess of the new item's cost, the remainder is lost. Success As critical success, but you can only apply 75% of the deconstructed item's cost to the new similar item and 50% of the deconstructed item's cost to any single item. Failure You fail to deconstruct the item, wasting your time. You can try again. Critical Failure You fail to deconstruct the item and damage it in the process. You must either repair it before attempting again, or you can attempt to deconstruct it again but lose 5% of the value of the item.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"rare"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-1905","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You can grow an item from a living thing, most commonly a plant.

You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to Grow an alchemical item, the Magical Crafting skill feat to Grow a magic item, and the Snare Crafting feat to Grow a snare. To Grow an item, you must meet the following requirements. The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary. You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas for more information. You have an appropriate set of tools for growing the item. While cultivation and gardening tools are typical for plants, you might also use a different technique that requires a different set of tools. For instance, if you play music to help your plants grow, you might use a musical instrument instead. You must supply special fertilizers or other magical nutrients worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that quantity of fertilizers and magical nutrients when you Grow successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of magical nutrients you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You can also bring them with you in advance or forage for them with a skill like Herbalism Lore, gaining an amount of value based on the rules for Earn Income. You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Grow the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. Depending on the specifics of the type of item, it might be easier to Grow than it is to Craft, or vice versa; typically, the GM can represent that by making an easy or hard DC adjustment. If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the fertilizers and other magical nutrients you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in additional growth accelerants to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days cultivating the item. For each additional day taken, reduce the value of the accelerants you need to complete the item. This amount is determined using Core Rulebook Table 4–2: Income Earned, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in accelerants. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. You also have the option to allow the item to grow mostly untended, only stopping to supervise it occasionally, though the pace is much slower without your direct intervention. At the end of each season in which you spent at least 1 day of downtime to Grow the item, roll an additional Crafting check and reduce the value of accelerants you need to expend to complete the item by the corresponding amount. Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting. Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank. Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over. Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the fertilizers and nutrients you supplied, but you can salvage the rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"rare"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-1924","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Calmly swigging a drink on the battlefield turns your foe's attempt to frighten you against them.

The forge can be used to work metal as a normal forge (although fuel must be provided)—the heat created by its use does no harm to the ice forge , nor does it transmit to the surface it sits upon, making an ice forge an ideal solution for those who seek to use forges in areas where open flames or smoke would be dangerous. You can return an ice forge to its handheld anvil form by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which has the auditory trait.

For example, a bastard sword requires one hand, even though it gets a benefit in two hands from the two-hand trait. Therefore, a shifting bastard sword could turn into a longsword, but not a greatsword. Activating this rune doesn't change how many hands you're currently using to hold the weapon.","category":"action","actions":"Single Action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-2344","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Make a Strike with the weapon.

You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items and the Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items. To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements: The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 17th or higher, you must be legendary. The item must be common, or you must otherwise have access to it. You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield, or an alchemist's lab to produce alchemical items. You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You attempt a Crafting check after you spend 2 days of work setting up, or 1 day if you have the item's formula. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in materials to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item. This amount is determined using the Income Earned table, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of Crafting appears in the sidebar below. Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting. Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank. Failure You fail to complete the item.

It's easiest to steal an object that is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch).

After the end of the process, the philosopher's extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature's unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon's breath, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature's DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature's physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants. Unlike normal for mutagens and polymorph effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls, you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional concoction you drink. However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you've consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation may leave some amount of your personality and memories intact, at the GM's discretion.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-2486","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":" Serithtial  spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th-rank   heal   or   ring of truth   spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).","source_raw":["GM Core pg. 302"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["GM Core"],"type":"Action","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=2486","frequency":"once per hour","weakness":{},"release_date":"2023-11-15","rarity_id":1,"name":"(concentrate)","id":"action-2486","text":" Activate (concentrate) Frequency once per hour; Effect Serithtial spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th-rank heal or ring of truth spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).","category":"action","exclude_from_search":true,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-2487","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You recall the  shot of the First Vault , which automatically reloads itself into your weapon.

You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining. Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor. Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances). When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want. Feats You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat. Skills You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites. You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation. Class Features You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard school—always at least a month.","category":"action","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"action-2635","_score":2.4044645,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You cast   force barrage   of the indicated level.
