A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.","category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"trait-130","_score":3.659727,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it.","source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 635"],"trait_group":["Equipment"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"remaster_id":"trait-672","type":"Trait","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Traits.aspx?ID=130","weakness":{},"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"trait_raw":["Potion"],"name":"Potion","trait":["Potion"],"id":"trait-130","text":" Potion Source Core Rulebook pg. 635 4.0 A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it.","category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"trait-131","_score":3.659727,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait.

A clockwork creature must be wound regularly to function. Clockwork items are Intricate, complex machines that use clockwork to function. Not all require daily winding, but those that do have the wind-up ability in their stat blocks. Wind-Up : To remain operational, a clockwork vehicle or creature must be wound with a unique key by a creature. This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time. A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself. A clockwork's operational time doesn't decrease in standby. A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, a clockwork vehicle loses 10 minutes of operational time, while a clockwork creature loses 1 hour. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode. Broken clockwork vehicles have difficulty holding energy. The first time each round that a broken clockwork vehicle moves, it must attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, it loses 10 minutes of operational time.","category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"trait-333","_score":3.659727,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Sahkils are fiends that delight in spreading fear and unease among mortal creatures.

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again. To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you. Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit.

A combination weapon has a ranged form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage. The combination weapons table lists the ranged weapon statistics first and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon usage and the ranged weapon usage requires an Interact action. However, if your last action was a successful melee Strike against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a ranged Strike with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the ranged weapon usage, firing the ranged weapon just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon Strike. Since a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any fundamental runes. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a vorpal axe musket only applies the vorpal property rune when you're using it as an axe.

A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack modifier, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately, and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.","category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"trait-672","_score":3.659727,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"A potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","source_raw":["Player Core pg. 459"],"trait_group":["Equipment"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Player Core"],"type":"Trait","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Traits.aspx?ID=672","weakness":{},"release_date":"2023-11-15","rarity_id":1,"trait_raw":["Potion"],"name":"Potion","legacy_id":"trait-130","trait":["Potion"],"id":"trait-672","text":" Potion Source Player Core pg. 459 A potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"trait-673","_score":3.659727,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait.
