Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from create water or hydraulic push ). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a frost vial typically puts out 1 square of fire, and ray of frost is ineffective. Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation. If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action. Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire. --- Routine On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies, with a minimum of 1 square. You determine the squares the fire spreads into—typically those with the most flammable materials. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 1d6 fire damage, and any creature within the flames takes 4d6 fire damage. Both of these have a DC 17 basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from flames only once per round. (For simplicity, track damage only for the NPCs and their allies, not for the spectators; Turn 5 and Turn 7 have instructions regarding the spectators' health). The fire has an additional effect on each of its turns after the first. Turn 2 The chamber's northern door flies open and flames burst through, igniting the 10-foot-by-10-foot area in front of the door. All fires spread on subsequent turns, at the same rate listed above. Any fires that join together become one fire for this purpose. Turn 4+ Creatures in the room take 1d6 damage from smoke inhalation at the ends of their turns. Anyone who uses an Interact action to tie a wet rag around their nose and mouth (or uses another creative solution) halves the damage. Turn 5 Spectators still inside the room fall unconscious from burns and smoke inhalation. Turn 7 Spectators still in the room die.","element":["Fire"],"exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"A fire engulfs the western door and a 10-foot-by-10-foot area immediately east of it, then spreads on each of its turns.","trait_group":["Hazard","Energy","Elemental","Planar","Monster"],"level":1,"source_category":"Adventure Paths","resistance":{},"url":"/Hazards.aspx?ID=63","source_group":"Age of Ashes","release_date":"2019-08-01","disable":"Eliminating the hazard requires dousing the flames. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from   create water   or   hydraulic push  ). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A  waterskin  doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire.  Cold  can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a  frost vial  typically puts out 1 square of fire, and   ray of frost   is ineffective.   Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation.   If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action.   Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire.","rarity_id":1,"trait_raw":["Complex","Environmental","Fire"],"name":"Town Hall Fire","category":"hazard","rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"hazard-64","_score":4.2101,"_source":{"hazard_type":"Trap","complexity":"Simple","source_raw":["Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill pg. 46"],"hp":44,"immunity":["critical hits","object immunities","precision damage"],"source":["Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill"],"type":"Hazard","speed":{},"weakness":{},"stealth":"DC 25 (trained)","trait":["Mechanical","Trap"],"id":"hazard-64","text":" Spiked Doorframe Source Pathfinder #145: Hellknight Hill pg. 46 Complexity Simple Spikes lance out of the doorframe to skewer anyone who attempts to open the door. --- Stealth DC 25 (trained) Disable Thievery DC 20 (trained) to deactivate a trigger built into the door's handle AC 21, Fort +12, Ref +8 Hardness 11 HP 44 (BT 22) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Spikes Single Action (attack); Trigger The door is opened.

As soon as this occurs, the portcullises to the east and west come crashing down, each consisting of solid iron sheets that form watertight seals. At the same time, the dozen 5-foot-wide trapdoors open in the ceiling. These holes are the mouths of winding tunnels that connect to a second pair of apertures on the submerged side of the island outside, allowing the waters of the Little Sellen River to plunge down into this room, possibly damaging or knocking prone those in the square portion of the room itself (but not in the adjoining hallway) and eventually flooding the entire chamber. --- Stealth DC +23 (master) Disable Thievery DC 26 (this increases to DC 30 once the trap is activated) to disable one of the 12 trapdoors and seal it shut; disabling all 12 of the trapdoors completely deactivates the trap, but a critical failure on any attempt causes the trap to trigger; Thievery DC 24 to disable one of the watertight portcullises and prevent it from falling; magic such as shape stone or wall of stone or even lock can also be used to disable portions of this deadly trap at the GM's discretion AC 25, Fort +23, Ref +15 Portcullis Hardness 16 Portcullis HP 70 (BT 35) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Rushing Water Reaction Trigger The secret door to the west or any trapdoor is opened. Effect The 12 ceiling trapdoors open along with the two secret doors to the cyclops zombie alcoves, releasing river water and zombies into the room. Any creature standing in the central 40-by-40 foot section of the main room must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save; the trap then rolls initiative. Critical Success Success The creature takes no damage. Success The creature takes 1d10+6 bludgeoning damage from the cascade of water. Failure The creature takes 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage from the cascade of water. Critical Failure The creature takes 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage from the cascade of falling water and is knocked prone. --- Routine (12 actions) The trap loses 1 action for each of its 12 ceiling trapdoors that are disabled. On each of the trap's actions, it pours water into the room, filling it to a depth of one inch. If all 12 trapdoors are open, it thus fills the room at a rate of 1 foot per round. If one of the portcullises is breached, the trap fills the room at half the rate, and if both are breached, it fills at one quarter the rate. Once the cascade of water begins, it's easy enough for a PC to avoid the downpour, but any creature that deliberately enters the cascade is subjected to the trap's Rushing Water reaction. If a creature is struck by Rushing Water while already underwater, the result of its Reflex save is automatically improved one degree of success. The flooding ends and the trap deactivates once the area is filled to the ceiling—at this point, the water's surface is at the level of the river, and at the top of the stairs leading down from areas D4 and D6 .
