Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—such as dispel magic —can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn't suppressed within the field.

It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.

Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay.

This magical rust can affect nonferrous materials, but the target must be all or mostly metal. Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell. All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on its target. - Creature or Hazard A creature or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). The grasp deals 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM. - Item The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure.

Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision. This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy. Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended.

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a Strike or Interacting to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for Strike and Interact, though occasionally it could be useful to have a temporal twin Stride through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a Strike and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, temporal twin fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast temporal twin . This action can't be used for anything but a basic single action, nor can it use limited resources. The action can have a different target than the original action but must be very similar in form.

Each foe within an 80-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're enfeebled 2 for 1 round; on a failure they're enfeebled 3 for 1 minute; and on a critical failure, they're enfeebled 4 for 10 minutes. A skeleton or other undead foe made almost entirely of bones treats their result as one degree of success worse than they rolled. Depart Bruising Departure The Bone Breaker pounds its long arms into the ground, creating a long shockwave. Each foe within a 100-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line takes 8d12 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Fortitude save. - Thorn Caller Size Gargantuan, Speed 100 feet; Arrive (evocation, light) Thorn's Guidance The Thorn Caller appears in a burst of light. The Thorn Caller's body is an ornate armored sphere with black panther masks surrounding a glowing light. The ball floats in the air due to six glowing, thornlike wings. Two clusters of bird heads emerge from both sides of the body with long necks that twirl together like tentacles. The Thorn Caller's burst of light illuminates all foes within 200 feet. The foes become dazzled and flat-footed, and if they were invisible, they become concealed instead. These effects last until the Thorn Caller departs. Depart Thorn-Burst The Thorn Caller launches its thorned wings at various targets. Attempt spell attack rolls against up to 6 different targets within 300 feet. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 piercing damage, double on a critical hit, half on a failure, and none on a critical failure. - The Thousand Size Medium (see below), Speed 30 feet; Arrive (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Disconcerting Arrival Select five spaces in range and summon a Medium-sized polyp of The Thousand in each of these spaces. The Thousand is an entity whose full scope is 1,000 polyps of oozing flesh, each physically separate but mentally part of a single creature. Not all 1,000 polyps have survived, and the spell summons five of them. Each creature within 10 feet of any of the polyps must attempt a Will Save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're frightened 1; on a failure, they're frightened 3; and on a critical failure, they're frightened 4 and fleeing for 1 round; Depart (illusion, mental) Violent Omen Each frightened foe within a 60-foot emanation of any of the five polyps takes 10d8 mental damage, with a basic Will save. - Scion of Desiccation Size Gargantuan, Speed 100 feet, fly 100 feet; Arrive (necromancy, negative) Ashes to Ashes The Scion of Desiccation appears in a swirl of screaming wind, a gargantuan form of twisted flesh that's constantly flensed by gritty ash and dust, and just as constantly regenerating itself. Each foe within a 40-foot emanation takes 10d10 negative energy damage, with a basic Fortitude save; Depart (necromancy, negative) Dust to Dust Each foe within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save; they're drained 2 on a failure or drained 4 on a critical failure.","tradition":["Arcane","Occult"],"range_raw":"250 feet","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You summon an ancient Fleshforged, one of Nex's personal weaponized monstrosities unleashed in the first wars against Geb.","trait_group":["School","Rarity"],"level":9,"source_category":"Lost Omens","resistance":{},"url":"/Spells.aspx?ID=1256","component":["material","somatic","verbal"],"release_date":"2022-11-16","rarity_id":3,"trait_raw":["Conjuration","Incarnate","Rare"],"name":"Summon Ancient Fleshforged","actions_number":6,"category":"spell","pfs":"Standard","actions":"Three Actions","rarity":"rare"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"spell-1257","_score":2.6890225,"_source":{"source_raw":["Impossible Lands pg. 306"],"heighten":["+2"],"range":100,"source":["Impossible Lands"],"type":"Spell","speed":{},"weakness":{},"heighten_level":[5,7,9],"spell_type":"Spell","duration_raw":"until the end of your next turn","heighten_group":["5th rank","Heightened 7th rank","Heightened 9th rank"],"school":"necromancy","trait":["Healing","Incarnate","Necromancy","Positive","Uncommon","Vitality"],"id":"spell-1257","text":"\nSummon Healing Servitor Three Actions Source Impossible Lands pg. 306 Traditions Divine, Primal Cast material, somatic, verbal Range 100 feet Duration until the end of your next turn --- You call forth a servitor forged from raw positive energy to heal and bolster your allies.

This advice is rarely more than two or three sentences long, typically spoken in Sussuran if you understand it, and Common if not. If you can't hear, the spirits blow small objects around to mimic written words or sign language.

The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the spell. It uses your spell attack modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes 3d4 mental damage. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.

These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a mirage spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.
