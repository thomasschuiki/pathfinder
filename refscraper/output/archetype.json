Multiclass Alchemist characters The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype are extremely useful to characters of any class. The following are just some of the possible combinations. Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect. Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further. Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don’t work. Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare. Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage. Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darksight elixirs to grant darkvision can prepare another spell instead of darkvision . <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-666\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-667\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-668\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-669\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-670\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-2","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"There’s a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.","source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 221"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Strength 14; Constitution 14","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=2","weakness":{},"archetype":["Barbarian"],"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Barbarian","id":"archetype-2","text":" Barbarian Source Core Rulebook pg. 221 4.0 There’s a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.

The many domains available to clerics of different deities present a variety of options for focus spells. Alchemist clerics work well with the chirurgeon field, healing various ailments with either alchemy or spells. Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch. Divine sorcerer clerics double down as the ultimate divine spellcasters.

With further training, you can become a true combat specialist. Multiclass Fighter characters The fighter archetype grants access to great feats for characters focusing on any combat style, and it’s particularly helpful for characters looking to diversify their offensive abilities or focus on more powerful weapons. Barbarian fighters can combine their talents with two-handed weapons with some of the fighter’s two-handed feats to devastating effect. Champion fighters focus on a style of combat exemplified by their deity. A shield-using champion benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats. Monk fighters are great at combining unusual weapon styles. For instance, a monks isn’t hindered by a restriction to keep one hand free, because they want to punch you with that hand anyway. Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual combat style combination. Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter’s free hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats. Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-710\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-711\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-712\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-713\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-714\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-8","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed you to hone your mind, body, and spirit to new heights.","source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 227"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Strength 14; Dexterity 14","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=8","weakness":{},"archetype":["Monk"],"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Monk","id":"archetype-8","text":" Monk Source Core Rulebook pg. 227 4.0 Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed you to hone your mind, body, and spirit to new heights. Multiclass Monk characters The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks. Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian’s excellent unarmed damage with the monk’s diverse unarmed special abilities. Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks. Fighter monks can supplement free-fighting and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit. Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks. Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and still use material components to cast spells. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-716\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-717\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-718\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-719\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-720\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-721\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-9","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set.","source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 228"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Dexterity 14","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"remaster_id":"archetype-215","type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=9","weakness":{},"archetype":["Ranger"],"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Ranger","id":"archetype-9","text":" Ranger Source Core Rulebook pg. 228 4.0 You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set. Multiclass Ranger characters The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to improve a character's monster knowledge and survival skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character wanting to become a dedicated archer. Alchemist rangers can add snares to their daily free items, benefiting from a strong Crafting modifier, and their Intelligence makes them exceptional with monster knowledge feats. The ranger archetype is also useful to bombers who want to alternate with in bow attacks. Champion rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of Erastil, both!) Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the best archery feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger. Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, and snares let them be on the other side of traps for a change. Spellcaster rangers benefit greatly from ranger's feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-723\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-724\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-725\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-726\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-10","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You’ve learned to sneak, steal, and disable traps.

Multiclass Rogue characters Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants. Alchemist rogues can use the rogue’s Poison Weapon to great effect with their daily poisons, and sneak attack is a nice boost to bomb damage. Barbarian rogues can become masters in every save and diversify their skills. Champion rogues add damage from sneak attack while protecting their flanking partners from harm. Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters. Monk rogues have great synergy, since many stances grant powerful Strikes that work with sneak attack. Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them flat-footed. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage. Spellcaster rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats like Mobility to help keep them safe. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-728\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-729\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-730\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-731\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-732\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-733\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-11","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You coax the magic power in your blood to manifest, accessing magic others don’t expect you to have.","source_raw":["Core Rulebook pg. 230"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Charisma 14","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Core Rulebook"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=11","weakness":{},"archetype":["Sorcerer"],"release_date":"2019-08-01","rarity_id":1,"name":"Sorcerer","id":"archetype-11","text":" Sorcerer Source Core Rulebook pg. 230 4.0 You coax the magic power in your blood to manifest, accessing magic others don’t expect you to have.

Not all Magaambyan attendants necessarily have this archetype, and this archetype doesn’t represent the abilities of all attendants; rather, the archetype represents many of those who have affiliated with a branch and are pursuing conversant rank. Halcyon Spells Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes. Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely. Magaambyan Archetypes These archetypes are uncommon, but characters who are Magaambyans of at least attendant rank have access to them. PCs who start off a campaign as members of the Magaambya typically begin at attendant rank and thus have access to these archetypes. The Five Branches of Scholarship Magaambyan scholars believe in many fundamental values of scholarship. Key among them are adaptability, camaraderie, imagination, knowledge, and valor. The school's faculty and lessons are divided into five branches, each emphasizing one of these values. Cascade Bearers esteem imagination , from the dreams of the most visionary magical theorists to the innovations of creative problem-solvers of all stripes. Emerald Boughs emphasize camaraderie , the sense of community and connection to fellow Magaambyans; they also interact with those outside the Magaambya and spread the academy's message. Rain-Scribes value adaptability in thoughts and deeds, as well as a willingness to admit errors and learn from past mistakes. Tempest-Sun Mages inspire valor , not only the physical courage to stand up for friends and the school, but also the intellectual courage to consider opposing viewpoints and widen one's understanding rather than staying entrenched in a single paradigm. Uzunjati understand that knowledge lives in stories passed down through the generations and also is earned every day through personal experience. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1103\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1104\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1105\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1106\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1107\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1108\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1109\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1110\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1111\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1112\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1113\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1114\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2166\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Magaambyans attendants have become full members of the Magaambya and begun to learn the secrets of the university.

Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe’s teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring. Halcyon Spells Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes. Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.

Beastmaster Animal Companions If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found here. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.

However, deities of any alignment can grant such a blessing, as long as they are capable of granting a positive divine font to their clerics.

You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Cavalier Pledges Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual.

The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence—or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path. As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge. Instinct of the Wyrm The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority. Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants. Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation.

Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending arrows zig-zagging nearly unerringly to their target, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. While having some spellcasting ability increases your potential flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake. Elven Arrows The ability to infuse eldritch energy into bow shots is often seen as a kind of elven magic. While it may be true that elves first developed eldritch archery as a martial art, and many eldritch archers are elves and half-elves, other peoples have learned and developed their own forms of eldritch archery. Some whisper that remote regions to the south have their own dedications that rely on elemental archery, while the strange and shadowy hunters of the Uskwood use a form that relies on tenebrous shadow magic. Disturbing rumors circulate claiming that devils have developed a diabolical form of magical archery that can trap the soul and bind it to Hell, albeit for a short time. Like any form of magic, the discipline of eldritch archery will continue to develop among its practitioners across the multiverse.

Within the darkness, monsters dwell, plans are hatched, and enemies strike with fang and dagger and dark magic. But some embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance within its shifting dark. A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal. Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious. Call of Shadows The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear—fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling. In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows. Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between.

Instead, when a battle takes place at a location of your choice, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes come to realize that you may have trapped any location on the battlefield, their fear of walking into another trap can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place.

Multiclass Summoner Characters The summoner archetype grants you an eidolon to join you in battle. It's a particularly helpful multiclass for characters with weaker martial abilities. Alchemist summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for construct or plant eidolons. Barbarian summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of anger phantoms, the two fueled by the same inner instinct. Bard summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a fey eidolon for a polymath muse or a phantom eidolon for a warrior muse. Champion summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their cause—angel eidolons for the tenets of good, devil eidolons for a tyrant, and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack. Cleric summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a Sarenite cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy. Druid summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the leaf order or beast eidolons for the animal or wild order. Fighter summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style. Monk summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife. Ranger summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon. Rogue summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The Unfetter Eidolon feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes. Sorcerer summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a psychopomp eidolon for the psychopomp bloodline. The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline. Wizard summoners are especially appreciative of an eidolon to help them in combat, and they tend to favor arcane eidolons like dragon and construct eidolons. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2954\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2955\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2956\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2957\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2958\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2959\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2960\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2961\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-97","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Secrets of Magic pg. 194"],"archetype_category":["Mystical","Core"],"source":["Secrets of Magic"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Uncommon"],"id":"archetype-97","text":" Cathartic Mage Source Secrets of Magic pg. 194 1.1 Emotions are powerful, and you can tap into that power to enhance your magic for a time. You learn to harness a particular emotional state under the right conditions, but be warned: emotions are volatile and destructive if left unchecked. The experience often leaves you reeling from the unhindered emotion, requiring a rest or distraction before tapping into it again. Click here for more rules on using this archetype. Emotional Focus Some emotional states, such as love or hatred, require the caster to focus on a specific individual called their emotional focus. Your emotional focus can change over time with you choosing a new focus after an important part of your story is resolved. Work with your GM to determine when this change happens. An emotional focus doesn't get a say in the matter; the cathartic spellcaster's emotions determine the bond. However, making another PC your emotional focus could result in an uncomfortable social dynamic.

Focus Spell Protector's Sacrifice Fear Source Secrets of Magic pg. 196 1.1 You let your fear fuel you, rather than consume you, but it burns your endurance. Catharsis Trigger An enemy makes you frightened. Catharsis Activation Increase your frightened value by 1, to a maximum of frightened 4. Emotional Fervor You don't take the status penalty from the frightened condition to your spell DCs or spell attack bonus. Instead, you gain a status bonus to spell attack rolls equal to the penalty you would've taken, and your foes take the same status penalty to their saving throws against your spells. Any other statistic takes the status penalty as normal. Spell: fear Emotional Fallout You are fleeing for 2 rounds, running from the source of the frightened condition that triggered your Catharsis.

Source Secrets of Magic pg. 206 1.1 , Rage of Elements pg. 58 You revere the four elements—air, earth, fire, and water—as the building blocks of creation and the source of all life. You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these four elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the four elements. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the four elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace the four elements equally as a mystical quaternity, and they strengthen their connection to one of these elements each day to protect themselves from harm. Others, notably sorcerer and wizard elementalists, feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other three elements to support and augment their favored element. Elemental Magic (1st) You're a spellcaster that's specialized in harnessing the four elements. Though you might feel a stronger kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping all of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list. Elementalist Adjustments : Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline and come from the options listed below. Druid Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a druid of the storm order, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge , with updraft . Wizard Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a wizard with an arcane school, instead of specializing in a school of magic, you specialize in one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Any benefits your arcane school would grant you that are associated with a selected spell school, you instead apply to your selected element. For example, if you select air as your element, you can prepare only spells that have the air trait in your extra arcane school slots, you can prepare an extra air cantrip, and you add an extra air spell from the elemental spell list to your spellbook. Additionally, in place of your arcane school spell, you learn the initial elemental focus spell of your selected element. In all other ways, your arcane school functions as written in the Core Rulebook . If you later select the Advanced School Spell wizard feat, instead of gaining the listed school spell, you gain the advanced elemental focus spell of your selected element. Elemental Focus Spells Air initial: updraft ; advanced: powerful inhalation Earth initial: crushing ground ; advanced: stone lance Fire initial: wildfire ; advanced: combustion Water initial: rising surf ; advanced: pulverizing cascade Click here for more rules on using this archetype.

Flexible Spell Preparation (1st) This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select Flexible Spellcaster Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day. Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a spellbook, a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows. You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels (see Table 5—1). Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips. During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard. You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had feather fall and magic missile in your spell collection, you could cast feather fall twice that day, magic missile twice, or each spell once. Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection. See the Restricted Spell Slots sidebar. ## Table 5-1: Flexible Spellcaster Spells per Day Level Cantrips 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th Collection 1 3 2 — — — — — — — — — 2 2 4 2 — — — — — — — — — 2 3 4 2 2 — — — — — — — — 4 4 5 2 2 — — — — — — — — 4 5 5 2 2 2 — — — — — — — 6 6 5 2 2 2 — — — — — — — 6 7 5 2 2 2 2 — — — — — — 8 8 5 2 2 2 2 — — — — — — 8 9 5 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — — 10 10 5 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — — 10 11 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — 12 12 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — — 12 13 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — 14 14 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — — 14 15 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — 16 16 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — — 16 17 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — 18 18 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 — 18 19 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 18 20 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 18 Your class most likely has a class feature that gives you a single 10th level spell slot that works a bit differently from other slots. If so, flexible spellcaster doesn't change the way that spell works. Heightening Spells Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast, similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day. Adjudicating Class Feats And Features Some of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in Counterspell, you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in arcane bond, you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.” The Counterspell and Leyline Conduit feats in the Core Rulebook need these substitutions, as does Form Retention from the Advanced Player's Guide . Spell Mastery provides additional restricted spells, like divine font or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells. Disallowed Feats The following feats from the Core Rulebook aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: Call of the Wild, Clever Counterspell, Infinite Possibilities, Reprepare Spell, and Spell Combination. The disallowed feats from the Advanced Player's Guide are as follows: Elemental Summons, Miraculous Possibility, Rites of Convocation, and Rites of Transfiguration. Click here for more rules on using this archetype. Restricted Spell Slots When applying this archetype to a class that grants additional spell slots with restrictions, such as the specialist wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine bond, you still gain those additional slots, but they work as normal for your class, and they don't add more spells to your spell collection. A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast heal spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add heal to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the harm spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.

You unlock secrets of a chosen school of magic while forsaking lesser schools. You learn the secrets of runic magic, the building blocks of magic. But be warned: you might succumb to sin in your pursuit of power. You also learn to use polearms, the signature weapons of the runelords, and can acquire the secrets of the mighty, ancient magic items called aeon stones , embedding them into your skin. Runelord Specialization (1st) You draw untold power from runes, sometimes called sin magic. You associate with one of the seven vices, also known as the seven rewards of rule: envy (abjuration), gluttony (necromancy), greed (transmutation), lust (enchantment), pride (illusion), sloth (conjuration), and wrath (evocation). Studying these techniques often tempts you with the associated sin. While leaning into it could corrupt you, it might make you more powerful. If you choose this class archetype, you must select Runelord Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must be a wizard specializing in one of the seven schools other than divination. Runelord Adjustments : In addition to the normal school spell for your chosen school of magic, you learn the initial rune spell associated with your school, with its school adjusted to your chosen school of magic if it wasn't from that school already. Your pool of Focus Points increases to 2 Focus Points. At 8th level, you also learn the advanced rune spell associated with your school, also adjusting its school to match your chosen school of magic if it wasn't already, and your pool of Focus Points increases to 3 Focus Points. You can Refocus by indulging in your school's sin in lieu of studying your spellbook. As you become more powerful, your indulgence grows. At 12th level, if you indulge in your sin to Refocus, if you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1. At 18th level, if you indulge in your sin to Refocus, if you have spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1. You are trained in martial polearms. At 11th level, if you gain weapon expertise, you become an expert in martial polearms. Finally, you lose the ability to prepare or cast any spell from your school's prohibited schools. You remove all spells of those schools from your spell list, meaning you can't even activate scrolls or wands of such spells. The Seven Schools The following seven schools are considered proper specializations of Thassilonian rune magic. In this paradigm, the Thassilonians considered divination magic to be something every wizard should learn but that none need take the effort to master. Abjuration (Envy) Runelords of abjuration specialize in protective magic and in suppressing all other magic to glorify their own. Prohibited Schools evocation, necromancy; Rune Spells initial: blind ambition advanced: competitive edge Conjuration (Sloth) Runelords of conjuration use their magic to create what they need as they need it, and call forth servants to do their bidding. Prohibited Schools evocation, illusion; Rune Spells initial: efficient apport , advanced: swamp of sloth Enchantment (Lust) Runelords of enchantment specialize in magic that compels and controls the minds of others, often to fulfill their own needs and desires. Prohibited Schools necromancy, transmutation; Rune Spells initial: charming touch , advanced: captivating adoration Evocation (Wrath) Runelords of evocation channel raw destructive energies and direct them toward all who would oppose their will. Prohibited Schools abjuration, conjuration; Rune Spells initial: weapon surge , advanced: zeal for battle Illusion (Pride) Runelords of illusion use magic to create the perfect appearance and fool others through trickery, deception, and misdirection. Prohibited Schools conjuration, transmutation; Rune Spells initial: veil of confidence , advanced: delusional pride Necromancy (Gluttony) Runelords of necromancy tap into their constant hunger for more power and enhancing their longevity, potentially even unto undeath. Prohibited Schools abjuration, enchantment; Rune Spells initial: overstuff , advanced: take its course Transmutation (Greed) Runelords of transmutation not only transform objects to create value, but also transform and enhance their own power. Prohibited Schools enchantment, illusion; Rune Spells initial: appearance of wealth , advanced: precious metals Click here for more rules on using this archetype.

Wellspring Magic (1st) You regain magic power quickly, but it can be difficult for you to control. You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire. Wellspring Mage Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways. You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1. A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. Critical Success You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. Success As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. Failure You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). You can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check. Wellspring Surges When your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so. Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead. If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies. A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects. ## Table 5-2: Wellspring Surges d20 Effect 1 Energy Unleashed (evocation) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge (basic Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst. 2 Positive Energy Expulsion (healing, necromancy, positive) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of positive damage, with a basic Will save. 3 Mass Siphon (transmutation) Creatures and objects within a 30-foot emanation become nearly weightless until the end of your next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can Climb at their land Speed and can Leap as far upward as they could normally Leap horizontally. 4 Magical Nemesis (conjuration, teleportation) A random creature connected to your magic (or inimical to it) appears within 60 feet. The creature should be of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by summon animal of the spell level, although it can be of any type. The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is unfriendly to you and friendly to your apparent enemies. After 1 minute, the creature can choose either to return where it came from or to remain. It is not summoned or a minion. 5 Monstrous Transformation (mental, morph, transmutation) Your head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to your magic for 1 minute. The GM determines the creature. You gain a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell level. At the start of each of your turns while you are transformed, you must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, you can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus. 6 Sudden Gale (air, evocation) Weather in a 40-foot emanation is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying. 7 Tremor (earth, evocation) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone. The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. 8 Oppressive Voice (divination, mental, nonlethal) The voice of your muse, your deity, an ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms your mind. You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a basic Will save. On a failure, you're also stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical failure). 9 Trinket Squall (illusion) Visual illusions of objects related to your magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve this illusion. 10 Antimagic Eruption (abjuration) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on you and on each creature within a 10-foot burst. 11 Mental Broadcast (detection, divination, mental) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of you can hear your surface thoughts. 12 Verdant Clutch (conjuration, plant) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet, causing all creatures in the area to be immobilized unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The Escape DC is equal to the spell DC. 13 Tinge of Terror (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright. They attempt a Will save, becoming frightened 1 on a failure or frightened 2 on a critical failure. 14 Strike up the Band (auditory, illusion) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks, a –2 status penalty to Deception checks, and makes certain uses of Stealth virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit. 15 Life Sap (necromancy) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become drained 1 and doomed 1, and you are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. 16 Ablative Barrier (abjuration) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0. 17 Luminous Pests (illusion, visual) Numerous tiny flying creatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from you, flying in a 30-foot cone. You and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure. 18 Emotional Turmoil (emotion, enchantment, mental) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm you from the surging magic. For 1 minute, attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a –2 status penalty to them instead. 19 Sudden Downpour (evocation, water) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst and attempting to counteract magical fires. 20 Spell Surge You immediately cast any spell in your repertoire of the surge's spell level or lower (or from your prepared spells or innate spells if you don't have a repertoire but have been forced to generate a wellspring surge). You must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast. Click here for more rules on using this archetype.

By predicting dangers and hazards and offering your insights to your comrades, you win battles through keen observation and teamwork. Whenever there's a threat or opening, you're the first to point it out, and you're ready to help your allies directly when necessary. As a group's overwatch, you might let the position go to your head. In such cases, you might think of yourself as the mastermind behind the chessboard and feel detached from your allies, thinking of them as little more than pawns on the field. But more likely your role allows you to feel a deeper connection to your allies, and your coordination and heroics stand out most when you subsume your individual ego to serve the group's needs. In that case, you might think of yourself as a part of a functional whole—if your party was a single living body, you serve as the eyes, but that doesn't mean you're the brain, the heart, or other vital organs. Everyone has a crucial role to play. Overwatch Training Not just anyone can train to become their party's overwatch. A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible. Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3119\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3120\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3121\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3122\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3123\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3124\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3125\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3126\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"With a stalwart mind and sharp eyes, you observe the battlefield as though you and your allies are pieces on a chessboard.

You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design. There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype. With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still “feel” what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo. As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit! Prosthetics in Golarion Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3128\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3129\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3130\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3131\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3132\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3133\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"While many people across Golarion use prosthetic devices, you've acquired and outfitted yourself with a particularly advanced combat model of …","trait_group":["Rarity"],"level":2,"source_category":"Rulebooks","resistance":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=110","archetype":["Sterling Dynamo"],"release_date":"2021-10-13","rarity_id":2,"trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"name":"Sterling Dynamo","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"uncommon"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-111","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Guns & Gears pg. 54"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style","Core"],"source":["Guns & Gears"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Uncommon"],"id":"archetype-111","text":" Trapsmith Source Guns &amp; Gears pg. 54 Wielding a wrench or blowtorch, you manufacture snares that whir and tick with delicate precision.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project. You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold. Unions Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks. Using Vehicles The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond.

You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Leading with a Cannon A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory. Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been “won” when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents. An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention. Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3223\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3224\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3225\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3226\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3227\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3228\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Limited","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-116","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Guns & Gears pg. 130"],"archetype_category":["Mystical","Core"],"source":["Guns & Gears"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Uncommon"],"id":"archetype-116","text":" Beast Gunner Source Guns &amp; Gears pg. 130 PFS Note Characters with a Home Region of Arcadia have access to all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of fireworks technician and demolitionist. The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia. The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond. To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight. You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine. Choosing Your Beast Gun A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.

The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle, and piercing screech—these are the stock and trade of your craft. You know how to perfectly pair light and sound to create fireworks displays that can amaze children and adults, comfort friends, and even confound your foes. As a fireworks technician, you might be an itinerant wanderer, roaming from town to town and developing your craft on your own. In that case, you make a living on the road, selling fireworks to the townsfolk, setting up public displays upon request and receipt of payment, and even tailoring individualized performances to those wealthy or interesting enough to be worthy of receiving their own private show. On the other hand, you might be part of an established fireworks house from Tian Xia or Vudra and rely on teamwork to perfect your various formulas and displays. Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks technology, you often send back the notes from your studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on your next big idea. Describing Your Fireworks Display As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your character's special abilities might matter significantly to you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same fireworks display, even if they come from the same fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate the display. In fact, it's likely that when you use a feat from the firework technician archetype, the resulting display remains a bit different each time as you tinker, perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3246\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3247\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3248\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3249\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3250\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle, and piercing screech—these are …","trait_group":["Rarity"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Trained in Crafting","source_category":"Rulebooks","resistance":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=119","archetype":["Fireworks Technician"],"release_date":"2021-10-13","rarity_id":2,"trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"name":"Fireworks Technician","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"uncommon"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-120","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Guns & Gears pg. 136"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style","Core"],"source":["Guns & Gears"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Uncommon"],"id":"archetype-120","text":" Pistol Phenom Source Guns &amp; Gears pg. 136 PFS Note Characters with a Home Region of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or the Shackles have access to all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of beast gunner, fireworks technician, and spellshot. Characters with a Home Region of Arcadia have access to all archetypes from Chapter 3 with the exception of fireworks technician and demolitionist. You treat combat as an art and your pistol as an extension of your performance. You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style. To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script. You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally! What Makes a Phenom? Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it. Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.

Skilled shooters who don't let their egos get in the way of their efficacy are likely to say that sniping is a two-person job. Taking down a target without giving away your position or giving the opponent a window for reprisal is difficult work that requires teamwork and coordination, as well as a tight-knit bond and shared perspective. Sniping duos live and die by the credo “two heads are better than one,” focusing their skills and strategies toward deadly efficiency. Whether your spotter and partner is a fellow ranged combatant or a melee enthusiast, you've learned how to use the openings they provide to devastating effect. Choosing a Spotter The most important aspect when choosing a spotter for the sniping duo archetype is the out of character component; make sure you team up with another player who is excited about the idea of roleplaying out teamwork and coordination in combat, and with granting you benefits and gaining benefits from you. The mechanics of the archetype are not very demanding of your spotter's actions, but that still doesn't mean every player is interested in the narrative component. Mechanically, a good spotter is likely either another ranged attacker or a melee attacker, and depending on the type of spotter you choose, certain feats might become more or less enticing. For instance, Targeted Redirection is more useful with a melee spotter. Additional Feats This archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level. Such feats are marked with a \\ .

Spellshots aren't ordinary gunslingers. They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears . Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes. Way Of The Spellshot (1st) You've learned the intricacies of magic and technology, blending the two together with deadly results. You combine a knowledge of arcane theories with a strong connection to your chosen weapon that allows you to manifest unique effects, though your knowledge doesn't extend as far as actual spellcasting.

Some people say you must be the luckiest soul in all of Golarion to still be alive and kicking after all the dangers you've seen. Others say that, given the circumstances and the number of foes who you've defeated seemingly by accident, that there's no way you can really be as incompetent as you seem. These critics claim there has to be some kind of angle, some racket you're running. Either way, you sure don't look or act dangerous, except possibly to yourself. Somehow, despite your apparent clumsiness, professed confusion, and known propensity to incite calamity, you find yourself standing after every battle. The same can't often be said for your enemies. Funny how that works out, isn't it? Skilled or Lucky Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how your character achieves their surprising success. Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign. If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the Deception skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and Confabulator that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent. If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point. You could also consider taking abilities with the fortune or misfortune traits, such as Halfling Luck or Harbinger's Caw.

Either way, as a Gray Gardener you draw power and authority from being masked and have a reputation for dispassionate justice. Your vigilante identity is that of a Gray Gardener, and you must be wearing a mask to use any of your vigilante feats or you risk exposing your social identity, as described in the vigilante archetype. Vigilante Archetype The Gray Gardener is accessed using the Vigilante Dedication feat, along with membership in the Gray Gardeners. Due to this unique membership, the Archives of Nethys is displaying the Gray Gardener specific feats on its own page.

You have a facility with words that draws others in, and you've always found it easy to sway others to your point of view. This ability has grown to the point where you're capable of innate magic. You can bend others' wills to your own by weaving alluring enchantments and compelling illusions. Perhaps this comes from a touch of fey or draconic blood in your family's distant past, or perhaps it's the work of some special boon or curse placed upon you. Captivators come from all areas of the world and all walks of life. A farmhand with the right gifts, sent to the market every week to hawk their latest crop, could find themself on the path to becoming a captivator. An urchin who relies on the sympathy of others just to survive may become a captivator out of necessity, and a noble, immersed in a deadly game of luxury and influence, might have trained to be a captivator since birth. Regardless of background, most captivators use their abilities to advance their station in life, make things easier for themselves, or befriend those who can help them achieve their goals. Good captivators use their gifts and skills to bring people together. They might turn a would-be tavern brawl into a night of sharing drinks and telling stories. They might offer encouragement to those facing depression or doubt. They excel at ending conflict peacefully and efficiently, leaving everyone around them happier. When faced with violence, they use their magic to quickly subdue or enthrall enemies while minimizing harm to their companions. Evil captivators manipulate others to achieve status, wealth, and power. They have no qualms about deceiving someone or using their magic to cause harm. Evil captivators are dangerous tricksters whose enchantments and illusions make them seem harmless, unimportant, or friendly. The slick politician, the devious con artist, the cunning courtier—these are all roles that an evil captivator can easily assume. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3359\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3360\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3361\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3362\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3363\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3364\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3365\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3366\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3367\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-126","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the …","source_raw":["Grand Bazaar pg. 122"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Able to cast spells; Trained in Arcana, Trained in Nature, Trained in Occultism, or Trained in Religion","archetype_category":["Mystical"],"source_category":"Lost Omens","source":["Grand Bazaar"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=126","weakness":{},"archetype":["Spell Trickster"],"release_date":"2021-10-13","rarity_id":1,"name":"Spell Trickster","id":"archetype-126","text":" Spell Trickster Source Grand Bazaar pg. 122 Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks. The Fruits of Research While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence. This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions. The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3369\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3370\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3371\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3372\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3373\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3374\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3375\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3376\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3377\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3378\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3379\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3380\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3381\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3382\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3383\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3384\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3385\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3386\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3387\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3388\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3389\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3390\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3391\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3392\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3393\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-127","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Wrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill against powerful foes.

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the somatic components of their spells while grabbed. Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs use specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing the creature creates a stronger bond between mount and rider. Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on grappling techniques to make sure they're never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods. These matches feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.

Over time, this pact slowly changes the initiate internally and, sometimes, externally as well. The initiate's mind slowly fills with ancient pieces of lore and techniques that are as much part of the saumen kar as their hands and feet. As the initiate's mind adapts to this knowledge and power, their body sometimes evolves in kind—sprouting sweeping horns, gaining heightened olfactory senses, and growing additional height and muscle—becoming a hybrid between their old ancestry and saumen kar, wrapped in runic tattoos. An unwilling creature can never be forced to become a pactbound initiate, and only those with deep bonds of mutual friendship with a saumen kar can even attempt the process. Befriending a saumen kar can be enough to begin one's initiation into the pact, though they must choose to accept the burden and can change their minds about undertaking the pact at any point until their final transition (represented by the Bound in Ice feat). Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar.

True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north. You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back. Mammoth Lord Animal Companions If you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules found here. As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your “active companion,” follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source. What Counts as Megafauna? The megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are. Large dinosaurs like the stegosaurus and triceratops qualify as megafauna, for example, but smaller dinosaurs like raptors don't. A list of well-established megafauna can be found below, but it isn't an exclusive list; other, more unusual, species might be permitted with GM approval. One rule is certain, however: an adult megafauna is always Large or bigger. Cave Bear : Use a bear's statistics for a cave bear animal companion. Daeodon : Use a boar's statistics for a daeodon, or giant boar, companion. Dire Wolf : Use a wolf's statistics for a dire wolf companion. Mammoth : Use a elephants's statistics for the statistics for an elephant or woolly mammoth animal companion. Roc : Use bird statistics for a young roc. Smilodon : Use cat statistics for a smilodon animal companion. Triceratops : Use triceratops statistics for a triceratops or other armored dinosaur, such as a stegosaurus or ankylosaurus. Tyrannosaurus : Use tyrannosaurus statistics for for a tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, or similar dinosaur. Woolly Rhinoceros : Use rhinoceros statistics for a rhinoceros or woolly rhinoceros animal companion. Additional Feats This archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.

You store these ghosts within a magical vessel called a spirit dwelling . This spirit dwelling might be a treasured family heirloom, an item you crafted expressly to help with exorcisms, or even just an odd trinket you found that happens to do the job. While the motivations of exorcists run the gamut, most are compassionate individuals who believe that every ghost, haunt, and spirit is simply a lost soul in need of rest. They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats. Exorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of Ashava the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, Sarenrae, Pharasma, and even Shelyn count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the spirit dwelling , exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things. Exorcists Across Golarion The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus to assist in their practice. Spirit Dwellings and Remnants A spirit dwelling can be any object, from an everyday item like a mirror, hand bell, or gemstone, to a custom clockwork device, so long as it can be held in one hand, is light Bulk, and doesn't serve another function (such as a weapon, shield, consumable, or magic item). Your spirit dwelling has the trait of the magical tradition used to take Exorcist Dedication and the necromancy trait. Your spirit dwelling is attuned to you, so only you can use it. If your spirit dwelling is lost or stolen, you can turn another object into a new spirit dwelling with a 1-hour ritual; this causes your previous spirit dwelling to revert to a mundane object and any spirits within to harmlessly disperse. Your spirit dwelling can house not just wisps but greater remnants of spiritual energy left behind by defeated ghosts and haunts. You can use the Collect Spirit Remnant activity. Rejuvenating Spirits : Though all spirit wisps and most remnants can pass on immediately when purified, if a spirit remnant came from a creature with the rejuvenation special ability (such as most ghosts), a recurring haunt, or another entity who ordinarily doesn't pass on when destroyed, its ties to this world are too strong for it to easily pass on. When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be. Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers—a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless. The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied. Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups—such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire—and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3460\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3461\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3462\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3463\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3464\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3465\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"It's quite common for mages of all sorts to study  necromancy —the surprisingly diverse school holds the secrets of  positive  and  negative  energy, …","trait_group":["Rarity"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Expert in Religion","source_category":"Rulebooks","resistance":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=172","archetype":["Hallowed Necromancer"],"release_date":"2022-04-27","rarity_id":2,"trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"name":"Hallowed Necromancer","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"uncommon"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-173","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You consider yourself an honorary  psychopomp —a shepherd of spirits who ensures the cycle of souls progresses unimpeded.

Although you're unable to safeguard the cycle of souls in its entirety, you strive to ensure each soul's time on the Material Plane proceeds without incident. You work to free souls from imprisonment, prevent necromancers from animating the dead, and destroy undead so their souls rejoin the cycle. While most who hunt undead do so out of fear, vengeance, or a desire to protect the lives of others, you take a more measured and far less emotional approach; you destroy undead so their souls can continue their journey along the River of Souls, thus ensuring the continuation of existence. You understand that without the cycle of souls, the life cycle of the planes is disrupted, and all of existence could be consumed by the Maelstrom. Nearly all soul wardens worship Pharasma or one of the psychopomp ushers, especially Barzahk the Passage, a psychopomp usher who routinely shirks their duties and needs help from mortal soul wardens. Soul wardens also often join organizations that regularly combat undead, including the Voices of the Spire and Ustalav's Ivory Reapers.

You know differently. As the vessels that once housed immortal souls, corpses hold great power and potential, perfect construction materials for creations of unsurpassed wonder. As a reanimator, you have chosen to focus your study of the necromantic arts on the transformation of dead flesh into innumerable varieties of undead, from the lowliest shuffling corpses and brittle skeletons to abominations of ghastly splendor barely conceived of by only the most fanatical—or brilliant— mortal minds.

Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires. Incorporeality, Flight, and Rejuvenation Many ghost abilities have been significantly toned down to work for a player character—most notably flight and the ability to move through walls with incorporeality. The GM has the option to loosen the reins on both abilities, allowing movement through walls as normal for the trait, granting an unlimited fly Speed of 15 feet, or both. The fly Speed replaces any other abilities that involve flying, and any feat that upgrades the PC's flying capabilities, such as the Unlimited Ghost Flight feat, might instead upgrade this Speed by an additional 5 feet. However, a PC who can constantly fly and move through walls can trivialize many low- and mid-level challenges, as well as a fair number of high-level challenges, consistently outshining or leaving other characters behind; the GM should consider this option very carefully before allowing it and adjust the game accordingly. Combining the rejuvenation feat with a character whose unfinished business is tied to the adventure essentially makes the character immortal. As with a lich's soul cage , even a group using other undead archetypes might want to avoid the rejuvenation feat or have it function more like a Rejuvenation Token. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3497\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3498\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3499\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3500\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3501\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3502\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3503\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Your ties to the living world cling to you in death, your unfinished business reducing you to a spirit.

While you can temper your hunger with long-dead flesh stolen from ancient graves, you much prefer devouring those who are freshly dead, whether as a scavenger or because you killed the creature yourself to ensure a fresh meal. Whether they stalk through the graveyards and crypts of Golarion or work together with other ghouls to build empires in the Darklands, ghouls care most about the consumption of dead flesh. The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving. Ghouls who go more than a few days without feeding on freshly dead humanoid flesh find themselves in constant pain; those who go for more than a week might be driven to the edge of delirium, becoming bestial in their craving. When you succumb to ghoul fever and become a ghoul, you don't lose your mind or memories. You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them. Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh. Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls. Hunger and ambition drive ghouls to rise through the ranks, which allows them to feed their hunger even more. Roleplaying a Ghoul When playing a ghoul, think about how hunger will affect your personality. Perhaps keep your character's personality as close to its original intent as possible, but with a slight twist. The desires and cravings of a ghoul are certainly strange and inhuman, but if you start emphasizing that right away, you don't have room to grow your portrayal of the character's descent into this hunger. As you get more ghoul feats, you can roleplay your character's diminishing aspects as ghoul-like characteristics emerge. As your character becomes more ghoulish, they loses old inhibitions and becomes more ambitious. Ambition, after all, is another sort of hunger. Adding these new ambitions gives you ways to portray the transformation besides just making your character a cannibal.

Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp. Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own soul cage . A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your soul cage would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear. Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their soul cage , spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function. Many wizard liches instead learn to tap into the soul cage 's magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting. Soul Cage The soul cage for the lich archetype is very similar to the lich soul cage from the Pathfinder Bestiary but has a few modifications to cover situations that might come up in play. While the story of the PCs sneaking in to destroy the NPC lich's soul cage is classic, it's difficult to have NPC adversaries do the same to the PC lich's soul cage without coming across poorly, similar to destroying a PC wizard's spellbook while it was off screen. Since that's the only way to defeat a lich, these table-dynamic concerns might effectively grant the lich PC immortality. Because of the way that changes the story and game play, even a group using the other undead archetypes in this book might want to consider whether or not to include the lich archetype. If you're looking for a compromise, consider having the soul cage act similarly to a Rejuvenation Token, requiring a ritual to awaken the lich's soul from within the cage.

Becoming a living mummy—one capable of both motion and thought—is another thing altogether. Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects. The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others—usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists—upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs. Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing. Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali.

One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way.

These minions shuffle forth with the mindless motions of the unliving and are little more than puppets under your control. Similarly, via careful tinkering and anatomical study, you learned how to make a powerful necromechanical ally. Finally, your technological prowess is such that you can use your innovations to force even powerful, free-willed undead to obey you. The secret to your success is a combination of alchemy and clockwork, machines and magic, science and spellcasting. Of course, crafting the shell of a wind-up zombie is one matter—your primary focus is on the craftwork necessary to make the whole thing work together. To you, the magic involved is only a means to an end, a way to make science more efficient through necromancy and potentially a little bit of evocation for some electric power. While some think your creations are vile, you see beauty in utility and believe animated corpses are tools that can be used for good or ill. For better or worse, when it comes to results, the science you've cobbled together fulfills the most important criterium for any new innovation: it works , plain and simple. Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would. Plus, they aren't vulnerable to positive energy, making them easier to use around good clerics and their ilk without your minions taking friendly fire.

Rather than skulking through the shadows, you use your training and latent supernatural abilities to become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out of your destination before anyone has a chance to think something is amiss. Performing an alter ego means going unregarded. Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd. This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent up, until you can't resist a dramatic reveal or a signature calling card that shows you were there. One final word before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually too late for your victims to do anything about it. Alter Egos in Golarion While some alter egos work independently as freelancers, they're especially popular in all sorts of espionage and intelligence agencies throughout the Inner Sea and beyond. The Lion Blades of Taldor, Twilight Talons of Andoran, Silver Ravens of Ravounel, and various Chelaxian secret police use alter egos to keep abreast of situations throughout the Shining Kingdoms and Old Cheliax. Meanwhile, powerful mercantile groups, like the Golden League in Tian Xia or the Aspis Consortium, employ alter egos for corporate espionage, making sure they always stay one step ahead of the competition. In Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse, the rebels known as the Bright Lions often seek the aid of alter egos to escape the notice of the mummified child god Walkena. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4132\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3808\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3809\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3810\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3811\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3812\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3813\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4149\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3814\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4152\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"A highly guarded castle in the middle of an extravagant ball, the headquarters of a city's infamous thieves' guild, the locked room in the back of a …","trait_group":["Rarity"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Trained in Deception; Trained in Stealth","source_category":"Rulebooks","resistance":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=187","archetype":["Alter Ego"],"release_date":"2022-07-27","rarity_id":2,"trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"name":"Alter Ego","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"uncommon"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-188","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Dark Archive pg. 140"],"archetype_category":["Mystical","Core"],"source":["Dark Archive"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Rare"],"id":"archetype-188","text":" Living Vessel Source Dark Archive pg. 140 With the dawning of a new era comes the need for a new seat of power, and what better way to show your coming master your devotion than by sacrificing your entire being for their use? You presented yourself before their altar and they answered your call, flooding your body with their power and granting you the gift of their original form. Or maybe you were abducted in the dark, on a night that the moon refused to shine, when you were taken to a profane location where a mysterious cult bound you to their master against your will. Now you have powers you didn't before and you have new features that scare (and maybe, in a small dark part of your heart, thrill) you. You might have even become a living vessel through a strange bargain. For instance, perhaps at the brink of death, you received an offer from an entity to spare your life in exchange for inhabiting you. Or you might have offered yourself to the entity in exchange for saving a loved one, for riches, or to fulfill a lifelong dream. Beings of any alignment can inhabit a living vessel. Evil-aligned beings, especially demons, are most likely to be interested in such an arrangement, especially if it involves forcefully taking over and changing the body and mind of a sapient being. Part of being a living vessel is learning more about your entity and finding what assuages them best and what their ultimate plans might be for your body and the world. Few vessels can fully dictate the terms of the arrangement, but the fact that you give the entity a corporeal form does give you some amount of leverage. Use it wisely. Additional Feats : Your GM might determine that you can take a pact feat from the pactbinder archetype as an additional feat, as long as the pact is made to the entity within you. For instance, if you're hosting a fey, you could make a pact involving fey.

As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities, otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens, amiable and unapproachable alike. Over the course of your many negotiations, you've learned something important: while such beings always seek a bargain tilted in their own favor, sometimes your definition of value differs enough from theirs that you can still come out ahead. In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you. All these things, you can and must consider in every pact. In addition to pacts, you might also pursue magical contracts. While less of a metaphysical commitment than a pact, contracts offer similar benefits you just can't resist— and you can employ your skill set as a pactbinder to manipulate the precise wording of the bargain. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3824\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3823\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3825\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3826\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3827\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3828\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"Some people feel that the universe is a constant struggle.

Most know that they are cursed, feeling an emptiness in their soul that weighs upon them, gnawing at their confidence and shrouding their ambitions. Sometimes, these curse maelstroms learn to control and channel their curse; you are one such unfortunate soul. You have a powerful curse living deep within you. You might have been able to restrain your curse for the most part, but it flares up occasionally and tempts you with the power to curse your foes, should you allow it to exert itself. Why should you be the only one who has to endure a cursed life when others have so clearly earned such woe? Living with a curse every day, you become intimately familiar with the workings of curses, getting a sense of when bad luck is about to befall those around you. You might try to avoid further bad fortune—which rarely pans out as you'd like—or you could come to terms with your lot in life and regard your curse as something akin to an old friend. Either way, fate cares little. Misery loves company, so your curse can even be a beacon for more misfortune. You might have multiple curses all tied to you, all fighting to make your life as hellish as possible. Manifestations Those at the center of a storm of curses often have peculiar manifestations that mark them as one of the unfortunate.

The veteran pyromancer bears the scorch marks of lessons learned. The archdruid grows to resemble plants or animals in their domain or grove. The professional reanimator can never quite cover up the stench of their grim work. The mark left by the practice of time magic is less obvious but no less indelible. With other disciplines, the marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned, creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers no such limitations of cause and effect. Distortions and anachronistic thoughts echo back throughout a time mage's entire life, providing a nonlinear perspective that others can find distracting or even alien. The threat of creating a paradox is ever looming. Many a reckless time mage has inadvertently erased themselves from existence, glimpsed a future they now have no choice but to enact, or attracted the attentions of temporal creatures, such as iriis or siktemporas. For these reasons, most mages merely dabble in time magic, learning a spell or two here and there. Despite the dangers, a brave few embrace the discipline, for it offers the allure of changing what was and controlling what will be.

Sleepwalkers dedicate themselves to unlocking the secrets of the sleeping mind, taking control of their dreams and walking through the slumbering vistas of others.

The Ursine Avenger Hood is such an item. After defeating a powerful cave bear, the Ulfen hunter Baruk shaped the bear's head and fur into a helm and cape for himself. Baruk later fell in battle against a linnorm, successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast. Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the Ursine Avenger Hood continues to grow in power alongside them. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4086\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4087\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4088\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4089\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4090\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4091\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4092\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4093\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4094\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4095\" />","category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-201","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"The Varki wizard T'aak Chamin once traveled from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings northward, past the Winterwall Glacier and deep into the frozen …","source_raw":["Treasure Vault pg. 184"],"archetype_category":["Artifact","Core"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Treasure Vault"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=201","weakness":{},"archetype":["Gelid Shard"],"release_date":"2023-02-22","rarity_id":1,"name":"Gelid Shard","id":"archetype-201","text":" Gelid Shard Source Treasure Vault pg. 184 1.1 The Varki wizard T'aak Chamin once traveled from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings northward, past the Winterwall Glacier and deep into the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World. T'aak was seeking immortality without the risk of undeath, and he followed the hints and clues of ancient legends that spoke of “the frozen immortals,” and of ancient magics of ice crafting that were once commonly traded between these rumored immortals and the Erutaki people, who share ancestral roots with the Varki. Little is known of T'aak's journeys in the northern wastes, though all accounts that record anything of the wizard and his trek indicate that the man who returned was different in many ways than the man who first traveled north. T'aak spoke of beings known as saumen kar, of a “great whale” sealed beneath the ice, and of strange corruptions. An account left by his wife mentions that T'aak often awoke screaming about “malignant sludge” and a “disease clawing at the ancient gates.” Despite all this, T'aak's primary quest did result in at least one notable accomplishment: the crafting of the first gelid shard . Gelid shards are arcane focuses of refined magical cold in physical form. Unfortunately for their creator, gelid shards do not grant immortality, though mortal creatures bonded to them do often have slightly longer lifespans thanks to the preserving cold that inundates and surrounds them. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4096\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4097\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4098\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4099\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4100\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4101\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4102\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4103\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4104\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4105\" />","category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-202","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Pathfinder #188: They Watched the Stars pg. 82"],"archetype_category":["Mystical"],"source":["Pathfinder #188: They Watched the Stars"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Rare"],"id":"archetype-202","text":" Scions of Domora May contain spoilers from Gatewalkers Source Pathfinder #188: They Watched the Stars pg. 82 Centuries ago, Domora Hume founded a lakeside city that would become one of the largest in western Sarkoris. When the city was attacked by raiders, Hume conjured a guardian from the lake to drive back the attackers. In the process, he also become the region's first god caller in generations. Hume's summoned savior was an ancient spirit guide from the Plane of Water named Dyzad. With Dyzad's guidance, Domorans summoned more such spirit guides, all of which the citizens worshipped as gods long after his passing. This tradition of god calling—and the worship of Sarkorian gods—came to define the city of Domora. In the ensuing years, countless pilgrims, Sarkorian or otherwise, came to Domora to learn of god calling. Many hoped to summon a god to bring back to their own people, while others petitioned the deities as a means of spiritual growth. Today, the Domoran god calling tradition is all but extinguished—wiped out during the Worldwound incursion. Nonetheless, worthy individuals who brave Domora's ruins might unbury a small fragment of this tradition. Although they aren't true god callers—they lack the ability to bond with greater spirit guides or unlock the highest levels of their power—such “scions” still forge unique relationships with lesser spirit guides.

Unlike other Ilverani, also called “snowcaster elves” by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass. This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people. To this end, you are ever on your guard against the lure of “modern fads.” Unfortunately, some twilight speakers have succumbed to the allure of other ways of life and, for them, there is only one outcome: exile. Ilverani and the Stars Twilight speakers hold the stars as an enduring reminder of their god's quest for artistic perfection. Although few Ilverani believe that Findeladlara had any hand in the creation of the stars, these astral bodies form an important part of snowcaster beliefs. Twilight speakers returning home look to Cynosure, the North Star of Golarion, to guide them. While the short polar summers in the Crown of the World can rob the sky of many stars, Cynosure shines bright and clear more often than not. It is for this reason that the envoys of the Ilverani gave themselves the name of “twilight speakers”: to remember their place as spiritual and diplomatic guides. Also in summer, the Aurora Iobara colors the sky in shifting tones. The “great painting,” as it is called in the Ilverani language, is contemplated by fortune tellers and prophets alike. Many Ilverani have noticed changes in the Aurora Iobara that they fear might point to the onset of another great cataclysm like Earthfall. The twilight speakers venture far and wide in search of information to support or dissuade such fears. During the long, cold nights of winter, when the stars are clearest, Ilverani hold their night vigils. While the stars turn in the sky above, they act out plays of their histories, tales that remember betrayal and great disasters. The stars are both backdrop and the personification of their ancestors, played by beautiful actresses with magical starlight in their hair. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4115\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4117\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4116\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4118\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4119\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4120\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"As a religious and diplomatic representative of  Findeladlara —and all Ilverani of the north—you see it as your duty to befriend shorter-lived …","trait_group":["Rarity"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Trained in Society","source_category":"Adventure Paths","resistance":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=203","archetype":["Twilight Speaker"],"source_group":"Gatewalkers","spoilers":"Gatewalkers","release_date":"2023-03-29","rarity_id":2,"trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"name":"Twilight Speaker","category":"archetype","pfs":"Limited","rarity":"uncommon"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-204","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"source_raw":["Stolen Fate Player's Guide pg. 13"],"access":"This feat is available to all players in a Stolen Fate campaign","archetype_category":["Mystical"],"source":["Stolen Fate Player's Guide"],"type":"Archetype","speed":{},"weakness":{},"trait":["Uncommon"],"id":"archetype-204","text":" Harrower May contain spoilers from Stolen Fate Source Stolen Fate Player's Guide pg. 13 Whether or not the revelations and divinations of a typical harrow card reading are trustworthy, none can deny that the strange powers wielded by the harrower are real.

To be a stalwart defender is to stand with the resilience of a mountain. When danger arrives you face it unflinchingly, allowing your enemy's blows to glance off you like wind whistling past granite. This mindset comes naturally to dwarves, while other ancestries typically need specialized training to attain the determination needed for such a style.

This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the elements. There are many paths to elementalism, and many classes can become elementalists. As the most basic building blocks of matter, the elements can be shaped to your specific training and understanding. The study of elementalism expands every day. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace either the philosophy of four elements common in the Inner Sea or the five-element cycle prevalent in Tian Xia. This is often a balance, but some elementalists feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other elements to support and augment their favored.

If you're using the version of the archetype from Secrets of Magic and are happy with it, you don't need to make any changes—that original version functions the same as using the new text and choosing Inner Sea elementalism for your elemental philosophy! Elemental Magic (1st) You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list. Elementalist Adjustments : Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use. Druid Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a druid of the storm order and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge , with updraft . Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments : If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline. Wizard Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rd-rank spell as the advanced school spell. Elemental Focus Spells Air initial: updraft ; advanced: powerful inhalation Earth initial: crushing ground ; advanced: stone lance Fire initial: wildfire ; advanced: combustion Metal initial: serrate ; advanced: repel metal Water initial: rising surf ; advanced: pulverizing cascade Wood initial: arms of nature ; advanced: wood walk Elemental Philosophy Choose an elemental philosophy, which determines which elements you can use. The options available in this book are as follows. Elemental Cycle : Earth, fire, metal, water, wood Inner Sea Elementalism : Air, earth, fire, water Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your spell list, with the spell list for elemental cycle elementalists found here and the spell list for the inner sea elementalist found here. In addition to some universal spells that both philosophies have access to, your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits. As Rage of Elements is the first book to include the wood and metal traits, your GM might allow you to add more spells from other books that fit the metal or wood element but first appeared without the trait, adding the relevant trait to the spell. You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to. For example, an Inner Sea elementalist couldn't select the Reverberating Spell feat, use Redirect Elements against a metal or wood spell, or choose a metal or wood ability for their Elemental Familiar.

While stonebound are most commonly found in dwarven enclaves, the practice of binding oneself to the nature of stone is found in the mountains of Garund, Vudra, Arcadia, and in various Darklands communities. A person who binds themselves to stone becomes more resilient to damage, capable of surviving for longer than their unbound counterparts, and often gains a deeper understanding of stone beyond mere knowledge. Historians theorize that this technique originated in Orv and spread from there. The practice of binding to stone is most common where elemental power, especially the essence of earth, is the strongest. This practice has begun to spread to Belkzen, throughout the Darklands, and across the deserts of northern Garund. Most recently, the Martial Mineral Masters in Quain have adopted the technique for their new dojo and flour mill. The most famous stonebound public figure is Sorrina Westyr, Spellmaster for the Pathfinder Society, who spent a decade in the Elemental Plane of Earth. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4378\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4379\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4380\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4381\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4382\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4383\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4384\" />","exclude_from_search":false,"skill_mod":{},"summary":"A stonebound is a devoted sentinel who draws on the power of the earth and stone to protect their people.

Multiclass Cleric Characters Although many characters profess faith in the gods, the cleric archetype represents a character of another class who’s been acknowledged by a particular deity and granted divine spellcasting. Before a character takes the cleric archetype, it’s important to consider the god’s anathema and whether they’ll be able to avoid it. The many domains available to clerics of different deities also present a variety of options for focus spells. Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch. Divine witch clerics double down as the ultimate divine spellcasters. Other spellcaster clerics diversify their options, becoming theurgic characters who combine two magical traditions. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5067\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5068\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5069\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5070\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5071\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5072\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-213","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.","source_raw":["Player Core pg. 218"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Wisdom 2","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Player Core"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=213","weakness":{},"archetype":["Druid"],"release_date":"2023-11-15","rarity_id":1,"name":"Druid","legacy_id":"archetype-6","id":"archetype-213","text":" Druid Source Player Core pg. 218 You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.

Multiclass Fighter Characters The fighter archetype grants access to great feats for characters focusing on any combat style, and it’s particularly helpful for characters looking to diversify their offensive abilities or focus on more powerful weapons. Bard fighters lead warriors from the front, using their martial skills to stay in the thick of combat where their audience is. Cleric fighters focus on a style of combat exemplified by their deity. A shield-using warpriest benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats. Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual combat style combination. Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter’s free hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats. Making multiple Strikes can serve them well. Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5082\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5083\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5084\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5085\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5086\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-215","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set.

Your keen eyes while hunting prey help gather more information. Multiclass Ranger characters The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to improve a character’s monster knowledge and survival skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character wanting to become a dedicated archer. Bard rangers support their allies and animal companions with expanded combat options. The bard’s knowledge can also complement the ranger’s investigation of their foes. Cleric rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of Erastil, both!) Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness. Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger. Some warden spells can also be particularly helpful to a fighter. Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, with their rogue skills naturally playing into the ranger’s strengths. Witch rangers add a new prowess scouting to the information they can gain through their familiar and patron. Wizard rangers benefit greatly from ranger’s feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5088\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5089\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5090\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5091\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-216","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You’ve learned to sneak, steal, and disable traps.

With time and luck, you’ll become capable of moving through the shadows, striking unseen, and escaping without notice. Multiclass Rogue characters Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants. Bard rogues expand their robust base of skills. They are also well-suited to take advantage of the distractions caused by their performances and otherwise apply their skills to combat. Cleric rogues often follow gods that support trickery in combat, such as Calistria, learning a combat style that fits their god. However, many clerics might need stealth and trickery when their voices are unwelcome. Druid rogues can ambush foes in other forms, seamlessly fading into the shadows of the natural world. Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters. Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them off guard. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage. Witch rogues apply the hexes of their patrons from the shadows and improve many of the simple weapons they’re trained in. Wizard rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats to help keep them safe. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5093\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5094\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5095\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5096\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5097\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5098\" />","category":"archetype","pfs":"Standard","exclude_from_search":false,"rarity":"common"}},{"_index":"aon30","_id":"archetype-217","_score":5.045321,"_source":{"skill_mod":{},"summary":"You have heard the whispers of a distant patron, who sent an emissary to teach you powerful magic.","source_raw":["Player Core pg. 222"],"level":2,"prerequisite":"Intelligence 2","archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source":["Player Core"],"type":"Archetype","resistance":{},"speed":{},"url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=217","weakness":{},"archetype":["Witch"],"release_date":"2023-11-15","rarity_id":1,"name":"Witch","legacy_id":"archetype-44","id":"archetype-217","text":" Witch Source Player Core pg. 222 You have heard the whispers of a distant patron, who sent an emissary to teach you powerful magic.
